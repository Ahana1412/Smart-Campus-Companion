## What It Does

Students and staff can:
**Post campus issues** (WiFi down, broken fan, mess feedback) with location & photos  
**Stay aware of temporary closures/alerts** (library closed early, canteen maintenance, lab relocation, festival traffic diversions)  
**Report Lost & Found** with optional image upload  
**Auto-categorize issues** and route them to relevant teams (IT, Hostel, Facilities)  

Built to deliver a **working prototype in ≤ 5 hours**

## Why This Matters

- **New joiners & visitors**: quickly know what’s open, what’s moved, and the safest/least-crowded routes.  
- **Students from out of town**: fewer surprises (closed counters, changed timings, maintenance outages).  
- **Campus ops teams**: structured, trackable reports instead of scattered messages.  
- **Leadership**: clarity via simple analytics (top issue categories, resolution throughput).
